# keyparty-sdk

TypeScript SDK for Keyparty credit management with multi-tenant support and subscription billing. Exports `KeyPartyClient` class for credit operations (`getCredits`, `addCredits`, `deductCredits`, `setCredits`), external user management (`createChildKey`, `getExternalUserCredits`, `addExternalUserCredits`, `deductExternalUserCredits`, `setExternalUserCredits`), and subscription lifecycle (`startExternalUserSubscription`, `stopExternalUserSubscription`, `getExternalUserSubscriptions`). TypeScript types include `KeyPartyConfig`, `CreditResponse`, `OperationResult`, `BatchOperationResult`. Built on Node.js v22+ with native fetch, zero runtime dependencies, automatic retry logic (configurable attempts/delay), and production-tested optimistic locking.

Installation: `npm install keyparty-sdk`. Basic usage: `const client = new KeyPartyClient(process.env.KEYPARTY_SERVICE_KEY, { timeout: 10000, retryAttempts: 3 }); await client.addExternalUserCredits('user_id', 100, 'reason')`. Multi-tenant pattern uses `externalUserId` (your app's user identifiers) instead of Keyparty's internal IDs. Subscription billing supports recurring credit allocation with configurable cycle duration. https://keyparty.dev
